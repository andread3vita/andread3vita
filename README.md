## 🚀 About Me

Hi there!!! My name is Andrea De Vita. Since I started high school, I have been interested in physics. What surprised me the most was the possibility of describing the universe through such tiny objects as particles. As I grew up, I delved into this passion, majored in physics and elaborated these concepts better. Now I am aware of the existence of fundamental interactions that govern the universe, and I'm chasing the dream of being able to investigate these topics firsthand.

During my academic path I have always thought that the best way to contribute in the world of experimental physics is to investigate alternative solutions to the state of the art instruments. For this reason I delved into ML technicques and their application to High Energy Physics problems. Moreover I am interested in the FCC proposal because I am aware of the limitations that are present in nowadays colliders. Indeed, I believe that it is possible to design a new generation of detectors addressing the requirement of possible physics discoveries.
